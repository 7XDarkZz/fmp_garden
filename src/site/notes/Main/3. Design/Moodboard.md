For my Moodboard I have collated lots of different images from lots of different places from everything from Star Wars to GTFO so that I have a wide range of sci-fi soldiers as comparing the designs from Titanfall to Halo, they are extremely different but collecting a wide range is what I need to do so that I have lots of different styles and designs to pull from when creating my own and I will narrow it down when I get to the concepting stage. I have designs here that have helmets on or off different styles of helmets one image has them wearing futuristic gas masks - maybe my character is equipped to go into hazardous areas - these are all things I will be considering when moving onto the concepting stage.
