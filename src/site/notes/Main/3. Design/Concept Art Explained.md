## Concept Art Explained

I made 5 initial concepts to begin with incorporating different parts from my moodboard such as the first ones helmet looking a bit like a bike helmet. I made 5 very heavily armoured even though it was against what I have outlined, I did this so that I could look to see if I wanted to pivot and make a heavily armoured character and also so that I can pull from parts of that armour to create my final character. You will also notice that I made my characters have different poses and cloaks so that I can decide on how the final render will look. 

After I made my initial 5 concepts I then broke them down further and started combining different parts of different concepts so that I could see how they would look. I eventually got this down to 1 concept that had took mainly from concept 1 and also used a shortened cloak from concept 3, I will still also have to model the armour underneath the cloak and I think I will take that from concept 2.
