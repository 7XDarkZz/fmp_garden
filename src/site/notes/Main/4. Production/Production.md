## Setup

I started by finding a basic low poly human model that I could use as a base to figure out proportions and so that I could create my own mesh over it either by sculpting or hardsurface modelling (dependant on the situation).

## Helmet

I started making the helmet using hardsurface techniques but I found that it was hard to create the shapes that I wanted particularly when it comes to making the visor so I ended up starting again with sculpting.

![Pasted image 20240425105131.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425105131.png)

I started with a sphere and remeshed it in sculpt mode with **R** to set the size of the voxels and **CTRL + R** to apply it. I also made sure that mirroring was on in the top right corner of the screen. After this I made the basic head shape using different adjustment tools such like the grab brush and snake hook brush. 

![Pasted image 20240425113619.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425113619.png)

![Pasted image 20240425111733.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425111733.png)

From here I remeshed again with more voxels and started adding detail using mainly the clay strips brush to add or take away volume and the crease brush to accentuate certain edges I mainly use it while holding **CTRL** to do the inverse so instead of pushing the mesh in it is pulling it out. I also made sure to smooth certain areas where needed with **SHIFT**. 

![Pasted image 20240425112537.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425112537.png)

I made some adjustments to the mesh using the yellow adjustment brushes again mainly the grab and snake hook brushes to improve the shape and added more detail using the crease and clay strips brushes.

![Pasted image 20240425112608.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425112608.png)

I continued making adjustments and adding detail, in particular I didn't know what to do with the top of the helmet as I wanted to have these two raised lines but wasn't sure how to do it. I tried many different techniques but none of them worked until I landed on using the crease brush to raise up these parts. At this point it looks a lot better than previous attempts but it still isn't where I want it to be, as it isn't pronounced enough (the opposite problem to my other attempts),  so you will see me messing with this area a lot in the upcoming screenshots to get it just right.

![Pasted image 20240425112945.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425112945.png)

Here you can still see me adjusting the overall shape of the helmet and you will see that I connected the chin and nose area as based off of what peers had said it looked a bit off so I added volume using the clay strips brush to connect them and used the crease brush to refine the shape creating the indent and harsh edge on the outside of the shape.

![Pasted image 20240425113649.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425113649.png)

Here you can see me again experimenting with the top "lines" of the helmet and also creating the back of the helmet as previously it was blank. Again this was all done with the clay strips and crease brush, but on top of the "lines" themselves I used a mixture of the flatten brush and the smooth brush which I think helped the issue of them being too pronounced from before.

![Pasted image 20240425114240.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425114240.png)
![Pasted image 20240425114340.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425114340.png)

Here you can see I added an "earpiece" bit obviously very unrefined but I simply used the clay strips brush and moved my pen in circles then smoothed it out and used the crease brush on the edge so that it felt like a separate piece to the rest of the helmet.

![Pasted image 20240425114814.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425114814.png)

Here you can see me refining the shape even more using the flatten brush to make a flat surface for the earpiece and then using the crease brush for detail and the grab brush to adjust the shape slightly so it is taller than it is wide. It is still not perfect but when doing retopology these issues will be fixed.

![Pasted image 20240425121031.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425121031.png)

## Chestplate

I started by creating a cube and scaling it then adding edge loops and scaling them to make this shape.

![Pasted image 20240425121848.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240425121848.png)

I then remeshed the shape and used the crease tool to create these lines.

![Pasted image 20240429101049.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429101049.png)

I cleaned up the model some more defining the lines more by smoothing out certain areas, using the scape and flatten tools in the middle to get those lines going top to bottom and used my adjustment tools (grab and snake hook) to get the overall shape of the armour.

![Pasted image 20240429103727.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429103727.png)

Here you can see I increased the resolution of the mesh and tried to clean up the lines a bit more improving their shape with the grab tool and also tried to make them slope downwards underneath the line instead of the line itself just sticking out, I did this using a combination of the smooth brush and the scrape and flatten brushes.

![Pasted image 20240429104217.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429104217.png)

After this I made a simple bit of cloth to connect the head to the body, its just a remeshed sphere that has been moved using the grab and snake hook tools to get the right shape and I have gone over it with the clay strips brush to make it look a bit more like cloth folding over on itself.

![Pasted image 20240429104502.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429104502.png)

![Pasted image 20240429104514.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429104514.png)

## Shoulder Armour

For the shoulder armour I simply added a cube with the subdivision modifier and simply moved edge loops and scaled faces to create the basic shape.

![Pasted image 20240429105854.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429105854.png)

I then remeshed the model and  used the crease tool on the outer edges to try to define the shape more, I also used the clay strips brush to add the line down the middle.

![Pasted image 20240429112508.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429112508.png)

Here you can see me using the same techniques to refine the shape more and I also brought the middle part of the model up to stop the clipping with the arm. I also used the scrape and flatten brushes on the top part and the sides to help create the shape I wanted.

![Pasted image 20240429112627.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429112627.png)

I increased the resolution and used the crease brush to bring out certain lines. It looks a bit messy here but when going through the remeshing process it should look fine.

![Pasted image 20240429112845.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429112845.png)

## Arms

I created the arms by creating a sphere and using the grab and snake hook tools to follow the arm of the human model I brought in. Once the overall shape was made I then followed the "XYZ rule" outlined in the video linked below to create the creases in the sleeve focusing particularly on the elbow joint as that is where the most creases would be.

![Pasted image 20240429113459.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429113459.png)

I kept messing with the model using many different brushes but mainly the crease and smooth brushes but whenever I wanted to add or take away volume I used the clay strips brush.

![Pasted image 20240429113603.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429113603.png)

![Pasted image 20240429113619.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429113619.png)

I also made the part where it is over the wrists with a basic design that I made using only the clay strips brush and also just cut off the extra part of the arm and just made a face which again looks messy right now but will be fixed when retopologizing.

![Pasted image 20240429114025.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429114025.png)

## Gloves

#### Remeshing / Triangle Problems

For the gloves I started by duplicating the hand on the base human model I had brought in but the model was all tris so when remeshing so that I could sculpt it would mess up the model.

Before remesh:

![Pasted image 20240429114451.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429114451.png)

After remesh:

![Pasted image 20240429114532.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429114532.png)

To fix this I used the "Tris to Quads" operation in Blender but as you can see it isn't perfect and still left a lot of tris behind. 

![Pasted image 20240429114625.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429114625.png)

When remeshing from this it still leaves a lot of problem areas such as in-between the fingers and just some weird geometry in some areas, its usable but I still decided to fix these particular areas manually by adding some loop cuts where necessary, using the join tool and dissolving problem edges.

![[Desktop 2024.04.29 - 11.51.54.02.mp4]]

In-between the fingers there wasn't much space to see the mesh so I used the UV editor  to see the geometry better buy unwrapping that area and using the "UV Sync Selection" button so I could just directly select verts and edges in the UV editor.

![Pasted image 20240429115621.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429115621.png)

![Pasted image 20240429115722.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429115722.png)

Remeshing after fixing these errors gave a much more usable mesh:

![Pasted image 20240429115828.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429115828.png)

#### Sculpting

For the glove itself I was basing the design roughly off of the CT side gloves from CSGO (top row):

![Pasted image 20240429120141.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429120141.png)

My first attempts went really bad as I hadn't really sculped these kinds of shapes before on a hand and I also couldn't abuse the mirroring which I usually heavily rely on, this lead to many attempts like this where I quickly end up restarting:

![Pasted image 20240429121141.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429121141.png)

Eventually I started making something I liked and I think its because I switched designs to what was going to be a mix between the original gloves and another set of gloves from CSGO:

![Pasted image 20240429121630.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429121630.png)

![Pasted image 20240429121324.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429121324.png)

Instead of eyeballing where the details should go I actually masked them out this time using the mask brush and getting the mask right first then using the "Mesh Filter" tool to bring all of the details out at the same rate.

![Pasted image 20240429121953.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429121953.png)

I then used the crease brush to define the shapes more and smoothed out the weird edges caused by the mask and mesh filter.

![Pasted image 20240429122036.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429122036.png)

![Pasted image 20240429122359.png](/img/user/Images%20and%20Videos/Pasted%20image%2020240429122359.png)

This is where I left it for now as I figured that adding more detail would be easier after retopology so I could use my hardsurface modelling skills. If it end up not being easier I can always append an earlier version of the model into my new file and use that to sculpt from.
