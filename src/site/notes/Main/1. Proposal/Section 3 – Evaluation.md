I will be comparing this model with other models I have made in the past to evaluate my progress and improvement that I have made specifically in sculpting and texturing areas as those are the areas I am weakest. For me to consider this project a success I want to have a full character model that has a degree of realism and is lit realistically. If I exceed my timeline I have some stretch goals in mind like rigging and animating the character and making a small animation to show this off. Throughout the project I will be evaluating my work as I go when talking about it in the main document but also at the end of each day in my journal, which I have already started. I will again be documenting as I work if my plans change and how I will make decisions about the project.

## S.W.O.T Analysis

#### Strengths

I am very good at hardsurface modelling and am very familiar with Blender.

#### Weaknesses

I am not very good at sculpting or texturing, and while I know how to use it I am not very good with Quixel Mixer.

#### Opportunities

This project will give me the opportunity to develop my sculpting skills within Blender and also develop my texturing skills within Quixel Mixer.
