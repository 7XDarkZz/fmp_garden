I will be comparing this model with other models I have made in the past to evaluate my progress and improvement that I have made specifically in sculpting and texturing areas as those are the areas I am weakest. For me to consider this project a success I want to have a full character model that has a degree of realism and is lit realistically. If I exceed my timeline I have some stretch goals in mind like rigging and animating the character and making a small animation to show this off. Throughout the project I will be evaluating my work as I go when talking about it in the main document but also at the end of each day in my journal, which I have already started. I will again be documenting as I work if my plans change and how I will make decisions about the project.

## S.W.O.T Analysis

#### Strengths

Within Blender I am extremely confident with my hardsurface modelling skills and believe that I can create high quality assets using those techniques, for this project that will be very helpful for retopology, or if I am ahead of schedule and have extra time to create more assets. I also have a computer at home capable of running Blender so if needed I have the opportunity to work from home.

#### Weaknesses

Texturing is by far my biggest weakness, most of my projects are let down by poor texturing as without the textures the model usually looks great but with them they tend to look lower quality. The main reason I think this is the case is because I usually go for realism which is very hard to get right compared to another stylized choice as we can tell when something is off because we see it so much, similar to the uncanny valley effect. That said I still think that I need to do realism as when I get good at creating realistic textures should then be able to create stylized textures as realistic textures are hardest to create and teach you more about how textures go together. I also think that my sculpting is still a bit weak but I have been practicing and I think that this project will be a good benchmark to see where my skill level is at.

#### Opportunities

This project gives me many opportunities specifically at developing my sculpting and texturing skills. Even though I have been developing my sculpting skills I still haven't attempted a project that relies this heavily on them yet and I will most likely be forced to learn new techniques by having to sculpt shapes that I have never sculpted before. As for texturing, while I am familiar with the process, I simply don't do it enough to be confident with my skills in this area and this project will allow me to experiment more with texturing within Quixel Mixer and should lead to a higher quality product at the end.

#### Threats

The main threat is the software, especially as I am planning on sculpting I expect Blender could be temperamental as at high polygon counts, which is what I will get when sculpting, it may crash when trying to significantly edit the mesh (e.g. adding a modifier) even though Blender has an autosave feature in case it fails I will still counteract this by saving multiple versions of my project often to ensure that my project doesn't corrupt or I loose a lot of work.
