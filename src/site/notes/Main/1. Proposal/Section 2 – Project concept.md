## Concept

I want to create a character with Blender using its Sculpting tools. I want to
create some kind of sci-fi soldier but I'm not sure exactly how I want it to look so I will need to create some moodboards and concept art to get a design I am happy with, I know roughly what I want - something along the lines of Star Wars mud troopers or the Helldivers soldiers. I have also seen a tent that can be turned into a poncho that stops soldiers from being seen in thermal vision and I want to incorporate something like that.

## Aims

I want to do this to improve my sculpting skills as this will force me to create something that looks good from a sculpting perspective but will also require my hardsurface modelling skills for the armour and I will also need to create realistic textures for the models to showcase them. 

## Resources Needed

- Blender for sculpting and modelling.
- Quixel Mixer for Textures.
- The Internet for research and troubleshooting.
- Obsidian for the write up, moodboards and concepts.

## Timescale
