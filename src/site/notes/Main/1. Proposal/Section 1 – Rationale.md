## Progress

Over the past 12 Units I have improved in many areas, I have gotten much better at basic hardsurface modelling which I was already good at, now being able to use multiple different softwares and learning new techniques. As for sculpting I was very bad before and I think I have improved a lot but still have areas to improve and that is partly why I have chose to do something sculpt-heavy for my project. As for game engines like Unreal I have also improved as I have learnt new techniques about modular modelling for rapid level design and have also improved in using Blueprints.  

## FMP Choice

I have chosen to create a character which is fairly sculpt-heavy. I have chosen this because I want to improve at sculpting as I am already very good at hardsurface modelling and I think that being able to sculpt will open many new opportunities for me both in terms of what I can do when creating something for myself and for what skills I will have for a future employer.
