I knew straight away that I wanted to create a design that was inspired by the Barracuda Soldier System[[Main/2. Research/Research References\|(1)]] because I saw it a while ago and think it looks like something soldiers of the future would use, I like how it is very practical looking and that translates into its real world use as it stops the user from being seen in thermal vision and they can take it off and use it as a tent for long excursions. This said when comparing this to sci-fi games and movies their soldiers often wear very heavy looking armour like in Halo[[Main/2. Research/Research References\|(4)]][[Main/2. Research/Research References\|(5)]] or Helldivers 2[[Main/2. Research/Research References\|(6)]]. 

One thing that bridges this gap is Titanfall 1&2[[Main/2. Research/Research References\|(2)]][[Main/2. Research/Research References\|(3)]] as within the game the "Pilots" are supposed to be very nimble able to run on walls and jump over large gaps and in order to succeed they have to be extremely fast and I think because of this I think the designers had to remove the big bulky armour that is usually associated with sci-fi soldiers and make something unique. They did this by stripping back the armour that they have as they have a main chest-piece, a helmet, kneepads and elbow pads - underneath this they just wear jeans or cargo pants and regular shirts just with army camo some of the bosses in the game are more heavily armoured but they are outliers and I think just have more armour to give them their own personality. Surprisingly giving them jeans and shirts doesn't really take away from the war aesthetic as it is done out of necessity as they need to be able to move fast and it also gives them the same aesthetic as freerunners as they just go out and perform stunts in jeans and t-shirts.

Going back to Halo, while they do have big bulky armour, there are still design features that I think are done really well - the helmets in particular are really well designed with you being able to tell a soldiers role based on their helmet e.g. if the visor is very thin and small then they are a sniper, if they have small antennas attached to their head then they have some kind of powerful radio. even when not looking at the helmets you can tell the difference between a Spartan and an ODST[[Main/2. Research/Research References\|(7)]] just from how much armour they have covering them and how bulky it is as Spartans are made to be strong but ODST are just regular humans and simply can't carry that much weight. I think this is something very important as, when making my own design, I want people to be able to discern what kind of soldier they are just by looking at them - how high ranking are they?, What's their role in a squad?, Are they part of some kind of special unit? - These are all questions that should be answered by the design alone.

As for Helldivers 2, I really like how while the armour is definitely bulky they have found a middle ground they have taken the Warhammer inspiration and made it more grounded - this is armour I could see people actually wearing if it were a couple million years in the future and I think that they have achieved this by taking parts from real world objects - for instance some of the helmets to me look like modified motorbike helmets. Here's a comparison:

I think this helps ground the armour designs in reality by taking something that we are familiar with and altering it to make their own style. Again this is something I want to try and do for my own character as I do want to make something that looks realistic so what better way to do it than have the foundations come from real world things?

I want to make armour that a "scout" would use, the wearer still needs protection which is where I will take design elements from Helldivers 2 and Halo like the overall design of the armour but still needs to be able to traverse large distances so needs to be light enough so I may trim it down a bit and this is also where I would take design elements from Titanfall like the fact that they only wear amour where absolutely necessary.

I think my research is good as I have covered a lot of different types of designs for soldiers but there is a definite lack of "light" armour and I don't think it is something I could have fixed as the majority of sci-fi soldier designs use very heavy-looking, bulky armour.
