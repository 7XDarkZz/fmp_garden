## Presentation

I started by using a program called Obsidian which is advertised as a note taking app, but I used it here as it is very quick to jot ideas down and I can also add plugins that let me customize it further such as allowing me to create my concept art within Obsidian using the Excalidraw plugin and I can also link to other pages within a document. That said it does come with its own downsides such as needing to know how to format the page in markdown such as putting a "#" before a line lets you create headings and putting multiple "#" lets you create subheadings. It also isn't very accessible for other people to access compared to Word or Powerpoint as they would also need Obsidian installed. 

Overall Word and Powerpoint are very accessible compared to Obsidian and are easier to format, Powerpoint in particular could have been a better way to present my work as you start on the first slide and simply go through each slide one-by-one this could have let me curate how I could have presented the information by having the reader see it in a specific order ultimately though I think it would have taken longer to go with this method over Obsidian as I would have to spread out my work for a section over multiple slides instead of just one long document. 

To solve the problem with Obsidian and accessibility I found a project called "Digital Garden" which allows me to convert and upload my Obsidian project to a website using Github and the Digital Garden plugin in Obsidian. The downsides to this is that I can only pick from pre-set themes which control the font, colours and layout of the website and I can't customize it much myself at all.

## Finished Product & Conclusion

I decided due to time constraints that I would not do the cloth simulation as it can be very annoying to set up and get looking good from previous experience.

Below I have 2 versions of the final product one that is textured and the other that is untextured to better show off the geometry.

### What Went Well

As for what went well, I really surprised myself with the sculpting portion as I think it turned out really good and considering that it was mostly sculpted and I hadn't done much sculpting beforehand it turned out amazing and I think that I have really improved my sculpting skills over the course of this project. I am also very happy with how the retopology ended up being, even though it did take a while, as I managed to get the whole model down to 128,770 triangles without loss in quality over the sculpted version which is really good as according to https://3d-ace.com/blog/polygon-count-in-3d-modeling-for-game-assets/ and many games like helldivers characters being similar polycounts shows me that my model is within the rough polygon limits laid out by most studios.

### Improvements

Improvements wise, texturing is the main one as the textures that I quickly made do not look very good mainly because I am not good at texturing in general it is my weakest point in the 3d pipeline and also due to time limitations I didn't have time to create better textures in Quixel, which is specifically designed to create realistic textures and had to create textures within the Blender shader editor instead, which while powerful in its own right is a completely different work flow being node based while Quixel is layer based like photoshop.

### Time Management

Usually I am quite good at time management for these long projects but for this one it was really bad. I started by outlining a timescale in [[Main/1. Proposal/Section 2 – Project concept\|Section 2 – Project concept]] which had a table outlining what I would be doing week by week and even made a Gantt Chart to go along with it as it is more readable. I ended up not sticking to this as at first I realised it would be quicker to sculpt everything rather than do a mix of hardsurface and sculpting. This worked out well but then I got to retopology and even while using addons within Blender to make it go easier and quicker it still took way too long as I had assumed that I could do it all in a week due to my previous experience with hardsurface workflows. But I quickly found that it was going to take a lot longer than I expected, not because it was hard but simply because the process takes a long time. This ultimately led to a lower quality product as I had to either drop doing things entirely like the cloth simulation or cutting down on them such as the textures where I still managed to do them but in a limited manor.

### Conclusion

Overall I am very happy with how my model turned out as it follows industry standard polygon counts for main characters in UE5 and looks really good. This said I have some obvious areas to improve, firstly I need to get better at texturing as in the final product it is the one thing that really lets the model down the most. The main thing I need to improve at is time management as retopology took much longer than I expected and I think this is because I hadn't done it before and I assumed that it wouldn't take this long so in the future I will either have more experience with it so I am faster at doing it or I will give it the proper time that it needs when laying out a timescale.
